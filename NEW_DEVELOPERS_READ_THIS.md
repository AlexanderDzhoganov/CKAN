 This document aims to explain the inner workings of CKAN. Hopefully, this will reduce friction for new developers entering CKAN development. Also, this document provides some level of insurance that knowledge of the codebase won't be lost when a developer leaves CKAN development.

 As with anything CKAN, this document is always open to changes and improvements. Be aware that any contribution should follow the (contribution guidelines)[https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md] and the (Code of Conduct)[https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/wiki/Code-of-Conduct].
